        <p>Hello, My name is Joshua Wright and I'm from San Antonio, Texas USA. I am a husband and father of 5 children. I am studying software development through BYU online and love it.
            I'm really excited to learn more about web development throughout this course. Something interesting about me is that I currently own a custom cabinet business and really enjoy it, 
            but would rather do something less physically demanding for a living but still do it very much as a hobby.</p>

        <p> The phrase, "Everything is bigger in Texas" comes as no suprise. The state of Texas is known for how large it is and all that it has. From the deserts in west Texas and El Paso to its lucious Southern Pine forests and swamp lands to the east on the Louisiana border. Texas has it all, not to mention the Gulf of Mexico or America along its southern coastline. It is home to some of the largest cities in the US and is rich with culture and delicious cuisine. </p>
